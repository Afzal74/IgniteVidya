# Quiz Real-Time Setup Guide

## Quick Fix (5 minutes)

Your quiz system has real-time code already implemented, but Supabase Realtime needs to be enabled for the tables.

### Step 1: Enable Realtime in Supabase (REQUIRED)

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Click **New Query**
5. Copy and paste this SQL:

```sql
-- Enable Realtime for quiz tables
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE quiz_rooms;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE quiz_participants;
ALTER PUBLICATION supabase_realtime ADD TABLE quiz_questions;

-- Add missing policies for participants
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Participants can update own record" ON quiz_participants;
CREATE POLICY "Participants can update own record"
  ON quiz_participants FOR UPDATE
  USING (true)
  WITH CHECK (true);

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Participants can delete own record" ON quiz_participants;
CREATE POLICY "Participants can delete own record"
  ON quiz_participants FOR DELETE
  USING (true);

-- Verify realtime is enabled
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
AND tablename IN ('quiz_rooms', 'quiz_participants', 'quiz_questions');
```

6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
7. You should see 3 rows returned showing the tables are now enabled

### Step 2: Restart Your Dev Server

```bash
# Stop your server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

### Step 3: Test Real-Time

#### Option A: Use Test Page (Recommended)
1. Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/quiz/test-realtime
2. Check if "Realtime: âœ… Enabled" appears
3. Click "Test Insert" button
4. Look for "ðŸ“¡ Realtime event received" in the logs
5. Open the page in another browser window
6. Click "Test Insert" in one window
7. Watch the other window for real-time updates

#### Option B: Test with Actual Quiz
1. **Teacher:** Create a quiz at `/teacher/quiz/create`
2. **Teacher:** Note the room code
3. **Teacher:** Stay on the lobby page
4. **Student:** Open `/quiz` in another browser/incognito
5. **Student:** Join with the room code
6. **Expected:** Student appears immediately on teacher's screen
7. **Test Multiple:** Join with 2-3 more students
8. **Expected:** All students see each other in real-time

### Step 4: Verify in Browser Console

Open browser console (F12) on both teacher and student lobby pages.

You should see:
```
Subscription status: SUBSCRIBED
Successfully subscribed to real-time updates
```

When a student joins:
```
Participant change: { eventType: 'INSERT', new: {...} }
```

## What Was Fixed

### Code Changes:
1. âœ… Added better error handling to real-time subscriptions
2. âœ… Added console logging for debugging
3. âœ… Added subscription status monitoring
4. âœ… Improved channel configuration

### Files Updated:
- `app/teacher/quiz/lobby/[roomId]/page.tsx` - Better real-time handling
- `app/quiz/lobby/[roomId]/page.tsx` - Better real-time handling

### Files Created:
- `supabase-realtime-fix.sql` - SQL to enable realtime
- `app/quiz/test-realtime/page.tsx` - Test page for debugging
- `REALTIME_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` - Detailed troubleshooting guide
- `QUIZ_REALTIME_SETUP.md` - This file

## Common Issues

### Issue: "Subscription status: CHANNEL_ERROR"
**Fix:** 
- Make sure you ran the SQL script above
- Restart your dev server
- Clear browser cache

### Issue: "Subscription status: TIMED_OUT"
**Fix:**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify Supabase project is not paused
- Check if firewall/proxy blocks WebSockets

### Issue: No logs in console
**Fix:**
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Clear localStorage
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Updates work but delayed
**Fix:**
- This is normal for free tier (1-2 second delay)
- Check your internet speed
- Consider upgrading Supabase plan

## Verify Realtime is Enabled

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime';
```

Should return at least:
- quiz_rooms
- quiz_participants
- quiz_questions

## Alternative: Check in Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to **Database** â†’ **Replication**
2. Find `supabase_realtime` publication
3. Verify it includes your quiz tables
4. If not, click **Edit** and add them

## Still Not Working?

1. Check `REALTIME_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` for detailed debugging
2. Visit the test page: `/quiz/test-realtime`
3. Check Supabase logs: Dashboard â†’ Logs â†’ Realtime
4. Verify environment variables in `.env.local`

## Success Checklist

- [ ] Ran SQL script in Supabase
- [ ] Verified 3 tables returned from verification query
- [ ] Restarted dev server
- [ ] Tested with `/quiz/test-realtime` page
- [ ] Saw "Realtime: âœ… Enabled"
- [ ] Tested with actual quiz (teacher + students)
- [ ] Students appear in real-time on teacher's screen
- [ ] Multiple students see each other in real-time
- [ ] Console shows "SUBSCRIBED" status
- [ ] Console shows realtime events when students join

Once all checkboxes are âœ…, your real-time quiz system is working!
