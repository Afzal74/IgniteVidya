# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create an interactive, scroll-based learning experience for the water cycle topic in 6th grade science. Using GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform), students will learn about the water cycle through animated visuals that respond to their scrolling behavior. As they scroll down the page, different stages of the water cycle will be revealed and animated, creating an engaging and memorable learning experience. The content will support both images and videos to illustrate each stage of the water cycle.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a 6th grade student, I want to learn about the water cycle through scroll-based animations, so that I can understand the process in an engaging and interactive way.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the student loads the water cycle learning page THEN the system SHALL display the initial stage of the water cycle with introductory content
2. WHEN the student scrolls down the page THEN the system SHALL progressively reveal and animate each stage of the water cycle (evaporation, condensation, precipitation, collection)
3. WHEN a water cycle stage enters the viewport THEN the system SHALL trigger smooth GSAP animations for that stage
4. WHEN the student scrolls back up THEN the system SHALL maintain the visual continuity of the water cycle stages
5. IF the student pauses scrolling on a stage THEN the system SHALL keep that stage's content visible and readable

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a 6th grade student, I want to see images and videos of the water cycle stages, so that I can better visualize and understand each process.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a water cycle stage is displayed THEN the system SHALL show relevant images or videos for that stage
2. WHEN a video is present in a stage THEN the system SHALL allow the video to play automatically or on user interaction
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure they are properly sized and optimized for the learning experience
4. IF media fails to load THEN the system SHALL display a fallback placeholder with descriptive text

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a 6th grade student, I want clear explanations for each water cycle stage, so that I can understand what is happening at each step.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each water cycle stage is revealed THEN the system SHALL display educational text explaining that stage
2. WHEN text appears THEN the system SHALL use age-appropriate language for 6th grade students
3. WHEN a stage is fully visible THEN the system SHALL ensure the text is readable with proper contrast and sizing
4. WHEN the student views a stage THEN the system SHALL present key concepts and vocabulary related to that stage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a teacher, I want the scroll-based learning to work smoothly on different devices, so that all students can access the content regardless of their device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the page is accessed on desktop THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scroll-based animations optimized for mouse/trackpad scrolling
2. WHEN the page is accessed on tablet or mobile THEN the system SHALL provide smooth scroll-based animations optimized for touch scrolling
3. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL initialize GSAP ScrollTrigger properly for the device type
4. IF the device has reduced motion preferences enabled THEN the system SHALL respect those preferences and reduce or disable animations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the water cycle scroll learning to integrate with the existing Next.js application structure, so that it follows the project's patterns and is maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the feature THEN the system SHALL use Next.js 14+ app router conventions
2. WHEN creating components THEN the system SHALL use TypeScript for type safety
3. WHEN styling components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS consistent with the existing project
4. WHEN adding GSAP THEN the system SHALL properly install and configure GSAP and ScrollTrigger plugin
5. WHEN the component mounts THEN the system SHALL properly initialize GSAP animations and clean them up on unmount

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want visual indicators of my progress through the water cycle content, so that I know how much content remains.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the student scrolls through the content THEN the system SHALL display a progress indicator showing their position
2. WHEN the student reaches a new stage THEN the system SHALL update the progress indicator accordingly
3. WHEN the student completes all stages THEN the system SHALL indicate completion visually
4. IF the student wants to navigate directly to a stage THEN the system SHALL provide navigation controls or section markers
