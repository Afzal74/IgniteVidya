## Troubleshooting

### If Database Setup Fails

**Error: "relation already exists"**
- ‚úÖ This is OK! It means tables already exist
- Continue to next step

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Check you're using the correct Supabase project
- Verify you have admin access

**Error: "syntax error"**
- Make sure you copied the ENTIRE file
- Check no characters were cut off

### If Teacher Signup Fails

**Error: "User already registered"**
- Just sign in instead (don't sign up again)

**Error: "Failed to create teacher profile"**
- Run the database setup again
- Make sure `teacher_profiles` table exists

**Error: "Invalid email or password"**
- Password must be at least 6 characters
- Email must be valid format

### If Quiz Creation Still Fails

**Error: "violates foreign key constraint"**
- Sign out completely
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Sign in again
- Try creating quiz again

**Error: "permission denied"**
- Make sure you're signed in as teacher
- Check RLS policies were created (run setup again)

**No room code generated**
- Check browser console (F12) for errors
- Verify all quiz fields are filled in

## Verification Queries

Run these in Supabase SQL Editor to verify setup:

### Check Tables Exist
```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('teacher_profiles', 'quiz_rooms', 'quiz_questions', 'quiz_participants')
ORDER BY table_name;
```
**Expected:** 4 rows

### Check Your Teacher Profile
```sql
SELECT * FROM teacher_profiles;
```
**Expected:** At least 1 row (your profile)

### Check Realtime Enabled
```sql
SELECT tablename 
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime'
  AND tablename LIKE 'quiz%';
```
**Expected:** 3 rows (quiz_rooms, quiz_participants, quiz_questions)

### Check RLS Policies
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename IN ('teacher_profiles', 'quiz_rooms', 'quiz_questions', 'quiz_participants')
