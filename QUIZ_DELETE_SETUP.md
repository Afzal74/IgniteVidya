# üóëÔ∏è Quiz Delete Functionality Setup

## Issue
Delete button not working due to database constraints.

## Solution

### Step 1: Run SQL Fix

Run `fix-quiz-delete.sql` in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This will:
-- 1. Fix CASCADE DELETE on foreign keys
-- 2. Verify RLS policies
-- 3. Enable proper deletion
```

### Step 2: Test Delete

1. Go to `/teacher/quiz`
2. Find any quiz room
3. Click the red üóëÔ∏è (Trash) button
4. Confirm deletion
5. Room should be deleted!

## What Gets Deleted

When you delete a quiz room:
- ‚úÖ The quiz room itself
- ‚úÖ All questions in that room
- ‚úÖ All participant records
- ‚úÖ All uploaded images
- ‚úÖ All quiz data

## Features Added

### 1. **Loading State**

This action cannot be undone.
